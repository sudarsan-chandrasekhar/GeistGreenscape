<center><u><bold><font face= "arial" size= "4" color="Black"> <i> Why Organic Lawn Care? </i></font> </u></center>

<!--Paragraph 2 explains why organic products are safer-->
<p>
Organic Products are safer for humans, pets, and the environment than synthetic fertilizers and pesticide.  Organic products enhance the quality of the soil, which will result in the soil being able to hold nutrients and water 
better.  Customers will enjoy the benifits of not having to mow, water, or fertilize the lawn as frequently.
Finally, scientific studies have shown that health risks are associated with lawn care chemicals. For example, 
many scientific studies have associated lawn chemicals with cancer and other long-term diseases.
